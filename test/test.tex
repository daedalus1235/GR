\section*{Metric}
You can raise an index by
\[g^{\mu\nu}a_\nu = a^\mu\]
You can lower an index by
\[g_{\mu\nu}a^\nu = a^\mu\]

The metric satisfies
\[g_{\mu\nu} = g_{\nu\mu}\]
\[g_{\nu\rho}g^{\rho\mu} = \delta^\mu_\nu\]

A vector is a vector if it transforms like
\[v'^\mu = \Lambda_{\nu}^\mu v^\nu\]
\[v'_\mu = \Lambda^{\nu}_{\mu}v_\nu\]
A tensor is a tensor if all of its indices transform as above.
